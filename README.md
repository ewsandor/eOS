Ed's Operating System
## About
Ed's Operating System (eOS) is an ever evolving operating system written for my own educational purposes only.  
### History
- c2011: My first attempt at writing an operating system was targeted for x86, but I only ever got some basic boot code running.
- August 2022: My latest attempt will be targeted for the ARM architecture (specifically Raspberry Pi) as single board computers are now readily available and practical.  It also appears ARM may be the way of the future as it has become more ubiquitous among mobile devices.  This iteration shares no code in common with the c2011 eOS.
